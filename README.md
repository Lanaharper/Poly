Decorations
Nothing makes me happier than walking into a store and seeing red and green everywhere. One of my favorite traditions is decorating the Christmas tree with my family every year. And riding around looking at Christmas lights is one of my favorite pastimes. No matter where you go in the holiday season, youâ€™re bound to see decorations that get you in the holiday spirit.
